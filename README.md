# Sales-Calculator

Part of a coding assignment to create a basic sale calculator. Requirements are as follows:

1. An interface showing products, the transaction, subtotal amount, tax amount, the final amount, a cancel/void button, and a save/export button.

2. There must be at least 10 different products, each with their own price, option to apply a 10% VAT tax, and belonging to 1 of 3 groups. You are free to decide what the products, groups, and prices are. An example of products and groups might be: apple/produce/tax=yes, orange/produce/tax=yes, chips/sundries/tax=no, windshield fluid/vehicle/tax=yes, etc

3. When a product is selected, it is added to the current transaction. The transaction must support up to 10 different products, listing product and price, and calculating subtotal, VAT, and total

4. A cancel or void button which, when pressed, clears and restarts the sale

5. A save or export button which, when pressed, saves or exports the current transaction in a JSON, XML, or text format.
